      <p>Understanding these Terms and Conditions</p>
      <p>When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms and Conditions, they have specific meanings (these are known as 'defined terms'). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning given to it in the section of the Terms and Conditions where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in brackets and speech marks).</p>
      <p>When we refer to "we", "us" or "our", we mean Issue Number One, LLC. Where we refer to "you" or "your" we mean you, the person using the Services.</p>
      <p>We have used headings to help you understand these Terms and Conditions and to easily locate information. These Terms and Conditions are only available in the English language. We will not file copies of the contracts between us and you relating to our supply of the Services, or between you and the Partners relating to the sale of the products, so we recommend that you print or save a copy of these Terms and Conditions for your records (but please note that we may amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time so please check the Website regularly, and each time you use the Services to order products, to ensure you understand the legal terms which apply at that time).</p>

    <li>
      <p>About us</p>
      <p>We are Issue Number One, LLC and we operate the Website. We are a company registered in the United States of America and our registered office is at 305 2nd Avenue, #721, New York, NY, 10003. Our registered company number is  81-0796028.</p>
      <p>We provide the Services to you through the Website. Further details of the Services we provide are set out in section 3 below. When you purchase products using the Website, you are purchasing them from the third party retailers ("Partner(s)") named on the Website. It is important that you understand that the contract for the purchase of the products is between you and the relevant Partner. We are acting as agent on behalf of the Partners, which are the principals. You are not purchasing the products from us. We are authorized by the relevant Partners to conclude the contract on their behalf but we are not a party to that contract and you are not purchasing the products from us. Further details about the products, the Partners and the contract between you and the Partners in relation to your purchase of the products are set out in sections 5, 6 and 7 below.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>Our services</p>
      <p>The Services we offer allow you to search through the Website and purchase products from a large number of Partner boutiques, showrooms and brands worldwide. As part of the Services, we also provide some ancillary services such as arranging delivery of the products, providing you with customer service assistance and payment processing without charge. The specific Issue Number One entity procuring such payment processing services will depend on your location. However, as stated above, the contract for the purchase of the products is between you and the relevant Partner. This means that it is the Partner (not us) who is legally responsible for selling the products to you.</p>
      <p>Please note that the delivery logistics service is being provided by us to you and as such you are entering into a contract for delivery services provided by us. We may make a charge for these services which will be shown at checkout and prior to your purchase of the products. Your contract with us is concluded once the products have been delivered to you by the courier or have been collected by you from a Partner.</p>
      <p>In order to use the Services you must be over 18 years of age.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>Our liability to you in relation to the Services</p>
      <p>If, in providing the Services to you, we fail to comply with these Terms and Conditions, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms and Conditions or our negligence, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time you started using the Services.</p>
      <p>We do not in any way exclude or limit our liability for: • (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence; • (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; • (c) any other liability which cannot be limited by law.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>The products</p>
      <p>We attempt to be as accurate as possible in the description of the products displayed on the Website. However, as the descriptions are based on information provided to us by the Partners (who remain responsible for them), we cannot guarantee that all details are always accurate, complete or error free. Please contact our Customer Service Advisors if you would like more information about a product. The images of the products on the Website are for illustrative purposes only, and although we attempt to display colors accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer's display of the images accurately reflect the true color of the products.</p>
      <p>We do not allow Partners to offer flawed items or products of lower quality than the corresponding market standards for sale on the Website. If an item you have ordered is not as described, is flawed or of a lower quality, you can return it to us and we will liaise with the Partner on your behalf. Once the item is received by the relevant Partner, you will receive a store credit, or alternatively a discount, replacement or repair for the item where possible, agreed on a case by case basis by us. We will refund you any applicable delivery charges and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the products (we will advise you whether the products will be collected from you or whether you need to arrange for them to be returned). Please see section 10 below for details of how to arrange a return. Please consider our prices are discounted to the lowest amount, therefore most sales are considered final. If you are a member of the IN. 01 deal group, we may offer returns on a case by case.</p> 
      <p>The products sold by the Partners are supplied for your domestic and private use only. You agree that you will not use the products for any commercial, business or re-sale purposes. You further agree that you will not export, reexport, or otherwise transfer the products to countries or territories that are the target of comprehensive embargoes or sanctions or to parties identified on the U.S. Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or the E.U.’s Consolidated Financial Sanctions List. Neither we nor the Partners have any liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, interruption of business or loss of business opportunity.</p>
      <p>Issue Number One guarantees that the Beauty products displayed on our site do not contain components that can cause risk to health, property or the environment.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>Issue Number One Partners</p>
      <p>As explained above, the contract for the purchase of the products is between you and the relevant Partner. We are acting as agent and are authorized by the relevant Partner to conclude the contract on its behalf but we are not a party to that contract and you are not purchasing the products directly from us.</p>
      <p>We request that all Partners using the Website have and maintain reasonable business policies which comply with our own business policies. We cannot, however, be responsible for the Partners’ business policies. If you are unhappy with the product or service you have received from a Partner, you should contact us and we will liaise with the relevant Partner on your behalf to try and resolve the issue.</p>
      <p>Further information about the Partners and the products they offer is available in our <a href="#">FAQ page.</a></p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>Orders, prices and payment</p>
      <p>The steps you need to take to place an order are explained in the "How to Order & Pay" section of our <a href="#">FAQ page.</a></p>
      <p>By completing the checkout process and placing an order by clicking the "Place Order" button on the checkout page, you are offering to purchase the products from the relevant Partner (and not directly from us). Your order for the products is subject to these Terms and Conditions which are incorporated into the contract between you and the relevant Partner. All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price, which is determined by the relevant Partner. After entering into the contract for the products with the Partner, the Partner will be under a legal duty to supply you with goods that are in conformity with the contract. Legal title to the product purchased will pass to you upon your payment being accepted. Risk in the product will remain with the Partner and/or Issue Number One (as applicable) until it is delivered to you at the address specified when you placed your order.</p>
      <p>To order products you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card (please see section (c) below for details of acceptable payment methods). By placing an order, you are promising that all details you provide are true and accurate, that you are over 18 years of age, that you are an authorized user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds in the account to cover the cost of your order.</p>
      <p>The Website allows you to check your order and correct any errors before completing a purchase. Please take the time to read and check your order at each page of the order process as you are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide is accurate (for example, the correct products, quantities, size, color, etc.).</p>
      <p>(a) Formation of the contract between you and the Partner(s). The identity of the Partner is shown on the order confirmation page when you place an order.</p>
      <p>When you place an order, you will receive an email confirming receipt of your order. This email is only an acknowledgement for information purposes and it does not constitute acceptance of your order by the Partner. The contract between you and the Partner in relation to the products will not be formed until we have checked that the Partner accepts your order. If your order is accepted, we will send you a confirmation email, which concludes the contract between you and the Partner. The confirmation email will include a description of the products purchased in the order and certain other information about your rights to cancel the contract between you and the Partner (please see section 10 below for further information on your rights to cancel the contract). Only those products listed in the dispatch confirmation email are included in the contract between you and the Partner.</p>
      <p>(b) Pricing and availability</p>
      <p>Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices that appear on the Website are accurate, as this information is provided to us by the Partners, there may be cases where errors occur. If we discover an error in the price of any products that you have ordered, we will inform you of this as soon as possible and, acting on behalf of the Partner, give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, your order will be treated as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the products, you will receive a full refund as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>If you are viewing the Website from a country in the EU, the product prices advertised on the Website from Partners located within the EU are inclusive of the VAT charged by the relevant Partner. Delivery costs are not included in the prices and will be charged in addition. The delivery costs (which will include VAT charged by us) will vary depending on the products that you have ordered and your delivery address. Please see the "Shipping Information" section of our FAQ page for further details. The delivery costs applicable to your order will be clearly displayed at checkout before you place your order (and are included in the "Total Cost" amount shown on the order summary page).</p>
      <p>Depending on your delivery address, different taxation rules and additional charges may apply. If you are shipping items from a Partner outside of your territory, you may need to pay import duties upon receipt of the products. We will notify you during the checkout process if import duties are included or you may have to pay them upon receipt of the products. If they are not included, neither we nor the Partner have any control over these charges and we cannot advise on their amount. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes that are not included. Please contact your local customs office for further information and a “landed cost estimate” before placing your order. Additional information is also available in the "Duties and Taxes" section of our FAQ page.</p>
      <p>For US customers, Issue Number One does not collect sales or use tax in all states. Issue Number One does not collect use tax for international purchases. For states imposing sales or use tax, your purchase may be subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Many states require customers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. For more details, please contact your respective taxing authorities.</p>
      <p>Please note that if you return an item, the taxes and import duties will be refunded to you if they were originally included in the purchase price. By initiating a return, you agree to disclaim and assign exclusively to Issue Number One (and to the exclusion of any other party), any right to or interest in duty drawback you may have with respect to the returned item.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Delivery</p>
      <p>The estimated delivery date of the products will be stated in your order confirmation email. If you do not receive an estimated delivery date from us, we will deliver the order within 30 days after the date of dispatch. We (and not the Partners) supply delivery services to you and we will try to ensure that your order is delivered by the estimated delivery date if given,) but there may be circumstances where delivery is delayed because of events beyond our reasonable control (please see section 15 below for further information). If this happens, we will try and arrange for your products to be delivered as soon as possible, but we will not be liable to you for any losses caused as a result of such delay.</p>
      <p>Delivery times may vary depending on the availability of the products and your delivery address. Delivery times, including for Same Day delivery, are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. The product(s) will be delivered to you directly by the Partner(s) so your order may arrive in multiple deliveries and at different times.</p>
      <p>If no one is available at your address to sign for your order, our delivery partner will leave you a note and you will need to contact them to rearrange delivery.</p>
      <p>In certain circumstances our delivery partner may provide you with the following options when delivering your order: (a) signature release: opting out of the requirement to provide a signature on delivery; and/or (b) leave with neighbor: re-directing the delivery to a neighbor (“On Demand Delivery Service”). By selecting to receive your order via the On Demand Delivery Service, you acknowledge and agree that Issue Number One shall bear no responsibility or liability for any loss or damage that may result from delivering your order in accordance with your request.</p>
      <p>Please also read the information on our Orders & Shipping page as this contains important information about your order and its delivery.</p>
      <p>We also offer the option to collect your order from a participating Partner. Please see our Click & Collect section for more details.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>International Delivery</p>
      <p>Details of the countries we deliver to can be found on our FAQ page. There are restrictions on some products for certain international destinations, so please review the information on that page carefully before placing an order.</p>
      <p>If you purchase products for delivery to an international destination, your order may be subject to import duties and taxes which are applied when the package reaches that destination. Please see section 7(b) (above) for more information on duties and taxes. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the products are destined. We will not be liable or responsible if you breach any such laws.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Returns Policy</p>
      <p>We offer the most discounted prices for exclusive, limited, and unique products, most of them considered sample products, therefore the majority of sales are final. Returns will only be accepted on a case by case. For further information on cancelling your order under the CCRs, please see below.</p>
      <p>Please note that in certain cases the Partner may reject your return of a product and Issue Number One (or any of its group companies) may, at its sole discretion, choose to purchase the product from you. You agree that legal title to such product will automatically pass to Issue Number One (or its relevant group company) upon Issue Number One (or its relevant group company) choosing to purchase such product from you.</p>
      <p>Cancelling under the Consumer Contracts Regulations</p>
      <p>Depending on where you live, you have a legal right to cancel your order under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 ("CCRs") or equivalent consumer legislation in the EU. This means that, during a certain cancellation period, if you change your mind or for any other reason you decide you do not want to keep the purchased products, you can notify us of your decision to cancel the order. Once the products are returned to the relevant Partner you will receive a full refund, including the original delivery costs; however you will be liable to arrange and cover the full cost of returning the order to the Partner.</p>
      <p>Except in relation to certain types of products as set out in the Returns Policy, you may cancel a contract at any time before your order is delivered.</p>
      <p>To cancel a contract, you must clearly inform us, preferably:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>By telephone on +1 (915) 543 0343</li>
        <li>giving us your name, address and order reference</li>
        <li>Or by completing and returning the cancellation form and sending it to the address set out in the form (form can be found on our FAQ page).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ethical sourcing policy</p>
      <p>As a reputable and trusted business committed to offering its customers high quality products, we recognize our obligation to ensure that all Partners and other suppliers are operating ethically. We expect all Partners and other suppliers to consistently provide an environment which protects their employees' health and safety and basic human rights. All Partners and other suppliers are expected to comply with their national employment laws and regulations with particular regard to: minimum age of employment, freely chosen employment, health and safety, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, no discrimination, no harsh or inhumane treatment, working hours, rates of pay and terms of employment. We will never knowingly allow a Partner to offer its products on the Website if such products are sourced from countries which are in breach of these principles. We also look to the Partners and other suppliers to install these principles when dealing with their own supplier base. Because of the sometimes complex nature of the Partners and other suppliers' supply chain, it is not always possible to monitor and control the conditions of each individual involved in the production of the products. However, as we continue to grow, we recognize the importance of being proactive and doing everything within our power to support the rights of those involved in the manufacture of the products. In order to address the changing needs of our customers, Issue Number One will not promote products without a sustainable approach. Fur products are defined as products made entirely from furs or made with fur trims. We also require all exotic skin products listed to have CITES certification and will not allow the listing of exotic skin unless permitted according to CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).</p>
