<p>This means that all applicable taxes and duties are included in the final purchase price when you place your order and there are no additional costs due upon delivery.</p>

<p>For US customers, Issue Number One does not collect sales or use tax in all states. Your purchase may be subject to sales or use tax, unless your state is exempt from taxation. Many states require a sales/use tax return filing at the end of the year for taxable purchases that were not taxed (including internet purchases) and payment of use tax on those purchases.</p>
